## Instructions

### Streamlining Form Filling Process with Spreadsheets

1. Introduction
   - Purpose: To demonstrate a faster way to fill out forms using a spreadsheet or CSV file instead of the traditional method in Redcap's user interface.
2. Exporting Data
   - Select the study of interest and export raw data to ensure column names match the form exactly.
   - Save the exported data as a CSV file for easier editing.
3. Filling Out the CSV File
   - Open the CSV file and align the column names with the form being filled out.
   - Refer to the codebook to find specific information needed for each entry, such as codes for certain data points.
4. Making Corrections
   - Double-check and correct any errors in the CSV file, ensuring data matches the required format and codes.
   - Save the edited file before proceeding to upload.
5. Uploading the Data
   - Use the data import tool in Redcap to upload the CSV file.
   - Ensure the record name matches existing study information to avoid errors during the upload process.
6. Checking for Errors
   - Redcap will perform a quick check to verify the data was successfully imported without any errors.
   - Review any error messages and make necessary corrections to the CSV file before re-uploading.
7. Troubleshooting Errors
   - If errors occur during the upload process, identify and address issues such as mismatched values or formatting discrepancies.
   - Make the required changes in the CSV file to align with the form's specifications.
8. Conclusion
   - The streamlined process of using a spreadsheet for form filling can save time and reduce errors in data entry.
   - Reach out for any further clarification or assistance with the process.

Notes:

- A record must be entered for each study
- Repeat records for subjects/participants, assays, and experiments. These would look like rows in a cell sheet
