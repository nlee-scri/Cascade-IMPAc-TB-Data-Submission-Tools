## SharePoint

SharePoint sites have a max capacity of 25 TB for storage (after that, we'd need to create another SPO site).
The top-end of the upload limit is 250 GB per file. Once the file is stored on the SharePoint site, it can grow past the 250 GB upload limit.
SharePoint sites are covered within our Microsoft Enterprise Agreement. Storage, access, etc., do not cost anything extra.
